# Service discovery based on Alibaba Cloud DNS Private Zone {#concept_efk_nsq_b2b .concept}

Alibaba Cloud Serverless Kubernetes supports service discovery. Currently,  service discovery for intranet SLB and headless service is supported.

## Alibaba Cloud DNS Private Zone {#section_q15_qsq_b2b .section}

Alibaba Cloud DNS Private Zone is a private domain name resolution and management service based on VPC \(virtual private cloud\) environment of Alibaba Cloud. You can map a private domain name to an IP resource address in one or more of the custom private networks, while your private domain names are not accessible in other network environments.

## Prerequisites {#section_cd5_h5q_b2b .section}

1.  You have activated Alibaba Cloud DNS Private Zone in the Alibaba Cloud DNS console.
2.  You have successfully created a Serverless Kubernetes cluster, see [Create a Serverless Kubernetes cluster](intl.en-US/User Guide/Serverless Kubernetes cluster/Cluster management/Create a Serverless Kubernetes cluster.md#).
3.  You have successfully connected to the Kubernetes cluster, see [Connect to a Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl](intl.en-US/User Guide/Kubernetes cluster/Clusters/Connect to a Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl.md#).

## Procedure {#section_u15_qsq_b2b .section}

1.  Connect to the Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl and run the following command to confirm the connection to the cluster.

    ```
    kubectl cluster-info
     Kubernetes master is running at https://xxxxxx.serverless-1.kubernetes.cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com:6443
    ```

2.  Deploy and create a service.  Currently, only intranet service and headless service are supported.

    Take the intranet service as an example. Create a sample nginx-deployment-basic.yaml file.

    ```
    vim nginx-deployment-basic.yaml
    ```

    The sample template is as follows, copy the following yaml code in the yaml file. Then run the `kubectl create -f nginx-deployment-basic.yaml` command to create it.

    ```
    apiVersion: apps/v1beta2 # for versions before 1.8.0 use apps/v1beta1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: nginx-deployment-basic
       labels:
         app: nginx
     spec:
       replicas: 2
       selector:
         matchLabels:
           app: nginx
       template:
         metadata:
           labels:
             app: nginx
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: nginx
             image: nginx:1.7.9 # replace it with your exactly <image_name:tags>
             ports:
             - containerPort: 80
     ---
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
       name: nginx-service-intranet # Access by service name as short domain name
       annotations: ## Add annotation
         service.beta.kubernetes.io/alicloud-loadbalancer-address-type: intranet
     spec:
       ports:
       - port: 80
         protocol: TCP
       selector:
         app: nginx
       type: LoadBalancer
    ```

    You can also create services of the headless service type, as shown in the following sample template.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: nginx-service-headless
    spec:
      ports:
      - port: 80
        protocol: TCP
      selector:
        app: nginx
      clusterIP: None
    ```

3.  Run the following command to view the health status of the application.

    ```
    kubectl get svc,pod,deployment
    ```

4.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud DNS console](https://dns.console.aliyun.com/).
5.  Click **Private Zone** \> **Zone List** in the left-side navigation pane to see that the record is automatically generated under this list.

    You can access Service \(long domain or short domain \) by the private domain name in VPC network environment.

    -   Long domain access: In this example, `nginx-service-intranet. $NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local`, where $NAMESPACE is the Serverless cluster ID, which can be seen in the console, or you can also use environmental variables in the yaml file of the pod.

        ```
        env:
               - name: NAMESPACE
                 valueFrom:
                   fieldRef:
                     fieldPath: metadata.namespace
        ```

    -   Short domain access: nginx-service-intranet or nginx-service-headless, the name of the service defined in the yaml template.
