# Overview {#concept_pc2_xyz_xdb .concept}

Alibaba Cloud Serverless Kubernetes allows you to quickly create Kubernetes container applications without having to manage and maintain clusters and servers. The Pay-As-You-Go billing method is applied, which is based on the amount of CPU and memory resources used by applications. With Serverless Kubernetes, you can focus on designing and building applications, rather than managing the infrastructure on which your applications run. Serverless Kubernetes is based on the Alibaba Cloud flexible computing infrastructure and is fully compatible with the Kuberentes API, combining the security, elasticity, and Kubernetes ecosystem of virtualized resources.
