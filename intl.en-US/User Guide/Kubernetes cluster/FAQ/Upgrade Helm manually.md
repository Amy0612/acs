# Upgrade Helm manually {#concept_f4p_nl4_d2b .concept}

Log on to the master node of the Kubernetes cluster, see [Connect to a Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl](intl.en-US/User Guide/Kubernetes cluster/Clusters/Connect to a Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl.md#).

Execute the following command:

```
helm init --tiller-image registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/tiller:v2.9.1 --upgrade
```

The image address can use the VPC domain name of the region corresponding to the image. For example, the image address of a machine in the Hangzhou region can be replaced by registry-vpc.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/tiller:v2.9.1.

Wait for tiller passing through health check. Then you can execute `helm version` to view the upgraded version.
