**Step 1: Grant roles to an account.**

For more information, see [Role authorization](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Swarm cluster/Authorizations/Role authorization.md#).

**Step 2: Create a cluster.**

You can select the network environment of the cluster, and set the number of nodes and configurations for the cluster.

**Step 3: Create an application by using an image or orchestration template.**

Select an existing image or orchestration template, or create a new image or orchestration template.

If your application is composed of services supported by multiple images, create the application by using an orchestration template.

**Step 4: Check the application status and the information of relevant services and containers after the deployment.**
