# What is Container Service {#concept_q41_5t5_tdb .concept}

Container Service provides the high-performance and scalable container application management service, which enables you to manage the lifecycle of containerized applications by using Docker and Kubernetes. Container Service provides multiple application release methods and the continuous delivery ability, and supports microservice architecture. By simplifying the setup of container cluster and integrating with the Alibaba Cloud abilities of virtualization, storage, network, and security, Container Service makes an ideal running cloud environment for containers.
