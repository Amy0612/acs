# Is Container Service charged? {#concept_ib3_dpn_vdb .concept}

1.  Currently, no additional fee is charged for Container Service except for the cost of resources you used, such as Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances and Server Load Balancer instances.
2.  In Container Service, the automatically created or manually added ECS instances and Server Load Balancer instances are billed according to the ECS and Server Load Balancer prices respectively. For more information, see [ECS billing method](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Pricing overview.md#) and [Pay-As-You-Go](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Pay-As-You-Go.md#).
