# Does Container Service charge fees {#concept_ib3_dpn_vdb .concept}

## Billing method {#section_wq2_c5q_d2b .section}

Currently, Container Service is free of charge. However, you have to pay for the resources you used, such as Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances and Server Load Balancer instances.

In Container Service, the automatically created or manually added ECS instances and Server Load Balancer instances are billed according to the ECS and Server Load Balancer prices respectively.Â  For more information, see [ECS billing method](../../../../intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing method comparison.md#) and [Server Load Balancer billing method](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/27692.htm) .
