# Does Container Service support granting permissions to sub-accounts in RAM console? {#concept_wzj_wxs_vdb .concept}

Currently, Container Service does not support granting permissions to sub-accounts in the Resource Access Management \(RAM\) console \(for cloud products that support RAM, see [Cloud services supporting RAM](../../../../intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Cloud services supporting RAM.md#)\). However, you can grant permissions to sub-accounts in the [Container Service console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com/#/overview/all).

For how to grant permissions to sub-accounts in the Container Service console, see [Use sub-accounts](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide/Swarm cluster/Authorizations/Use sub-accounts.md#).
